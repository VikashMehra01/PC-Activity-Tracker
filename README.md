PC Activity Tracker

A silent, background Python script for Windows that automatically tracks your application usage and logs the time spent on different activities. This tool is designed for personal analytics, helping you understand your digital habits, identify time sinks, and improve productivity.
Features

    Automatic & Silent Tracking: Runs invisibly in the background without a console window after a one-time setup.

    Detailed Activity Logs: Records every window change with a timestamp, process name, window title, and duration into daily CSV files.

    Daily Summaries: Generates structured JSON files for each day, providing a total time tracked and a nested breakdown of time spent per application and specific task/site.

    Smart Parsing: Intelligently cleans up window titles from browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge) and VS Code to provide meaningful, grouped data (e.g., logging "GitHub" instead of the full page title).

    Persistent Data: Loads the previous summary when it starts, ensuring a cumulative total for the entire day even if the script is restarted.

    Monthly Reporting: Includes a separate script (summarizer.py) to aggregate all daily summaries into a single, comprehensive monthly report.

How It Works

The core script, activityTracker.py, runs a continuous loop that checks the active foreground window every few seconds using the pywin32 and psutil libraries. When it detects a switch to a new window or application, it calculates the duration spent on the previous activity. This duration is then recorded in two places:

    A detailed entry is appended to the current day's CSV log.

    The duration is added to an in-memory Python dictionary, which is periodically saved as the day's JSON summary.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites

    Windows Operating System

    Python 3.x installed (make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation)

Steps

    Clone the Repository:

    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/PC-Activity-Tracker.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/PC-Activity-Tracker.git)
    cd PC-Activity-Tracker

    Install Dependencies:
    Open a command prompt in the project folder and install the required libraries from requirements.txt.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Running the Tracker Manually

To test the script, you can run it directly from the terminal. This will show startup/shutdown messages. Press Ctrl+C to stop it.

python activityTracker.py

Running Silently on Startup (Recommended)

To make this a true background utility, create a shortcut to run it silently whenever you log in.

    Press Win + R, type shell:startup, and press Enter to open the Startup folder.

    Right-click in the folder, select New -> Shortcut.

    In the "location" field, enter the command to run the script with pythonw.exe (which runs without a console window). Make sure to use the full paths to your Python installation and your script.

    "C:\Path\To\Your\Python\pythonw.exe" "D:\Path\To\Your\Project\activityTracker.py"

    Click Next, give the shortcut a name (e.g., "Activity Tracker").

    Important: Right-click the new shortcut, go to Properties, and set the "Start in" field to the directory where your script is located (e.g., D:\Path\To\Your\Project).

    Restart your PC. The tracker will now run automatically and silently in the background.

Generating a Monthly Report

To generate the summary for the current month, simply run the summarizer.py script.

python summarizer.py

File Structure

All data is saved to a PC_Activity_Logs folder on your Desktop.

    PC_Activity_Logs/

        DailyActivityLogs/: Contains the raw, detailed logs in .csv format, with one file per day (e.g., 2025-09-23-Activity.csv). This is your "source of truth."

        DailyUsage/: Contains the structured summaries in .json format, with one file per day (e.g., 2025-09-23.json).

    MonthlySummaries/ (in the project folder): Contains the aggregated monthly reports generated by summarizer.py.

Future Plans

    [ ] Idle Time Detection: Pause tracking when there is no keyboard or mouse activity.

    [ ] Data Visualization: Create a simple dashboard to display daily/monthly stats with charts.

    [ ] Android Integration: Develop a companion Android app to track mobile usage and sync data.
